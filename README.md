# Advent of code 2022

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenges.

I focused on having fun, rather building the most optimal solution. Other people will do that far better than me anyways.

## Usage

This repository depends on the [advent of code build tool](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc), and should be used with the `cargo aoc` command.
